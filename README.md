## Introduction

The objective of this exercise was to learn how to use an Rmd file to knit content and computation together. I tried to accomplish this through the following case study:

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
movement using activity monitoring devices such as a
[Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike
Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or
[Jawbone Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of
the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to
find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But
these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to
obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for
processing and interpreting the data.

This report makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

In this exercise to use an Rmd file to generate a report, the following steps are followed:

1. Load the data (i.e. `read.csv()`)

2. Process/transform the data 

3. Answer key questions and explain important steps, like:
<ul>
<li>What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
<li> What is the average daily activity pattern?
<li>Imputing missing values
<li>Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
</ul>
